<h3><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Research Profile (English)</h3>
<div class="about-block about-block-en">
I currently work at the College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology, where I engage in teaching and research within the fields of <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>Distributed Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Biomedical Sensing</strong></span>. My research interests are deeply focused on the interdisciplinary frontiers of <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>Distributed AI, Edge Computing, and Biomedical Signal Processing</strong></span>.

Centering on the core theme of execution determinism and inference reliability for complex physiological signal analysis in cloud-edge collaborative environments, I systematically investigate efficient sensing and intelligent decision-making under heterogeneous resource constraints. My research focuses on key technologies including high-robustness biomedical signal anomaly detection algorithms, interpretable deep learning models, and lightweight edge deployment and collaborative optimization for wearable devices. These efforts are dedicated to providing system-level solutions with both theoretical rigor and engineering feasibility for smart healthcare and autonomous sensing systems.

I was sponsored by <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>the China Scholarship Council (CSC)</strong></span> to pursue my Ph.D. at University College Dublin (UCD) and to conduct research on international standards for AI in telecommunications at <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</strong></span> in Geneva, Switzerland. Additionally, I spearheaded R&D projects in intelligent O&M and AI applications at Huawei 2012 Labs, winning the Global Championship of the "Huawei Time Series Anomaly Detection Challenge."

In recent years, I have authored over 10 publications in prestigious SCI journals and flagship conferences such as IEEE Sensors Journal, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, IEEE ICECS, and AICAS. I also serve as a long-term reviewer for leading international journals, including IEEE Internet of Things Journal and IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, and have been recognized as an "IEEE Young Professional."
